This is an SSPI CRAM programming implementation of ice40 Ultralite using STM32

I used STM32's built-in HAL library for GPIO control and SPI bus communication.

The instructions used for programming for this example is taken from FPGA-TN-02001-3.4( [ice40 Programming and Configuration](https://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=46502)) technical note. See below for the waveform instructions from the document.
